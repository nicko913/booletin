  <p class="meta">Terms of Service &mdash; Last updated: February 2026</p>

  <p>
    By using Booletin, you agree to these terms. If you don't agree, please don't use the service.
  </p>

  <hr />

  <h2>1. What Booletin Is</h2>
  <p>
    Booletin is a free, real-time broadcasting tool that lets users create and join temporary
    message channels. It is provided as-is, for personal and non-commercial use.
  </p>

  <h2>2. No Data Storage</h2>
  <p>
    Booletin does not store messages, channel history, or personal information on any server.
    All broadcasts are ephemeral — they exist only in memory while the channel is active and
    are permanently lost when the channel ends or the server restarts.
    Your display name is stored only in your own browser (localStorage) and never sent to us.
  </p>

  <h2>3. Your Responsibilities</h2>
  <p>
    You are solely responsible for any content you broadcast through Booletin. You agree not to use
    Booletin to transmit content that is illegal, harmful, threatening, abusive, harassing, defamatory,
    obscene, or otherwise objectionable. You must be at least 13 years old to use this service.
  </p>

  <h2>4. No Warranty</h2>
  <p>
    Booletin is provided "as is" without any warranty of any kind, express or implied. We do not
    guarantee that the service will be available at any particular time, error-free, or suitable
    for any particular purpose.
  </p>

  <h2>5. Limitation of Liability</h2>
  <p>
    To the fullest extent permitted by law, the creator of Booletin shall not be liable for any
    indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or punitive damages arising out of your use of,
    or inability to use, the service.
  </p>

  <h2>6. Changes to These Terms</h2>
  <p>
    We may update these terms occasionally. Continued use of Booletin after changes are posted
    constitutes acceptance of the new terms.
  </p>
